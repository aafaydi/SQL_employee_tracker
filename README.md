I have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).


## Description

This app is designed to track employees and create new ones all through the CLI." The solution was build for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
